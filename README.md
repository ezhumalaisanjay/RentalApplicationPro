## Missing Documents Feature

The application includes a separate missing documents page that integrates with Monday.com to track document status:

- **Access**: Navigate to `/missing-documents` or click the "Missing Documents" button in the main application
- **Functionality**: Search for applicants by their unique ID to view missing documents
- **Integration**: Connects to Monday.com board to fetch real-time document status
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/monday/missing-subitems/:applicantId`

### Example Usage

1. Navigate to the missing documents page
2. Enter an applicant ID (e.g., `app_1752839426391_2041fkmmy`)
3. View the list of missing documents for that applicant
4. Upload missing documents directly from the page using the secure upload feature
5. See applicant information and document status summary
6. Use the refresh button to check for updated document status

### Upload Feature

The missing documents page now includes a secure upload feature:

- **Secure Upload**: Each missing document has its own upload section
- **File Encryption**: All uploaded files are encrypted before transmission
- **Supported Formats**: PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG files up to 10MB
- **Real-time Status**: Upload progress and success indicators
- **Webhook Integration**: Files are automatically sent to the backend via webhook
- **Status Tracking**: Uploaded documents are marked with a green "Uploaded" badge

### URL Query Parameters

The missing documents page supports URL query parameters for direct access:

- **Direct Access**: Navigate to `/missing-documents?applicantId=app_1752839426391_2041fkmmy`
- **Auto-Search**: When an applicant ID is provided in the URL, the page automatically searches for missing documents
- **Shareable Links**: Use the "Share Link" button to copy a direct link to the current search results
- **URL Updates**: The URL automatically updates when searching to maintain shareable state

### Example URLs

```
# Direct access to specific applicant
http://localhost:5000/missing-documents?applicantId=app_1752839426391_2041fkmmy

# Clear search (no query parameters)
