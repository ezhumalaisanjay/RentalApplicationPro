# File Upload Encryption Setup

This application now supports encrypted file uploads using AES encryption. Files are converted to Base64 and encrypted before being sent to the server.

## 🔐 How It Works

1. **Frontend**: Files are converted to Base64 and encrypted using crypto-js
2. **Backend**: Files are decrypted and saved to the uploads directory
3. **Security**: All file data is encrypted in transit and at rest
4. **Form Submission**: Encrypted data is included in application submissions for complete audit trail

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Encryption key for file uploads (change this in production!)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secret-key-change-in-production

# Vite app encryption key (for frontend)
VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secret-key-change-in-production
```

### 2. Uploads Directory

The server will automatically create an `uploads/` directory in the project root when files are uploaded.

### 3. Security Notes

- **Change the encryption key** in production
- Use a strong, randomly generated key
- Store the key securely (not in version control)
- Consider using environment-specific keys

## 📁 File Structure

├── 1234567891_document2.jpg
└── ...
```

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### POST /api/upload-files

Uploads encrypted files to the server.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "encryptedData": "encrypted_base64_string",
      "filename": "document.pdf",
      "originalSize": 1024000,
      "mimeType": "application/pdf",
      "uploadDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "applicationId": 123
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Files uploaded successfully",
  "files": [
    {
      "originalName": "document.pdf",
      "savedName": "1234567890_document.pdf",
      "size": 1024000,
      "mimeType": "application/pdf",
      "uploadDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "path": "/path/to/uploads/1234567890_document.pdf"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

### POST /api/submit-application

Submits application with encrypted data included.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "applicationData": {
    // ... application fields ...
    "encryptedData": "{\"documents\":{},\"allEncryptedFiles\":[],\"encryptionTimestamp\":\"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"encryptionVersion\":\"1.0.0\"}"
  },
  "files": [...],
  "signatures": {...},
  "encryptedData": {
    "documents": {...},
    "allEncryptedFiles": [...]
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Usage

The encryption is automatically enabled for all file uploads in the Supporting Documents section. Users will see a shield icon indicating that files are being encrypted.

### Encrypted Data in Form Submissions

When a user submits an application, the system now includes:

1. **Encrypted Documents**: All encrypted file data organized by document type
2. **File Metadata**: Original filenames, sizes, and upload timestamps
3. **Encryption Details**: Timestamp and version information
4. **Validation**: Automatic validation of encrypted data structure

### Database Storage

Encrypted data is stored in the `encrypted_data` field of the `rental_applications` table as a JSON string containing:

```json
{
  "documents": {
    "applicant": {
      "paystubs": [...],
      "bankStatements": [...]
    }
  },
  "allEncryptedFiles": [...],
  "encryptionTimestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "encryptionVersion": "1.0.0",
  "totalEncryptedFiles": 5,
  "documentCategories": ["applicant"]
}
```

## �� Security Features

- **AES Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption algorithm
- **Base64 Encoding**: Ensures safe transmission of binary data
- **Unique Filenames**: Prevents filename conflicts
- **File Validation**: Size and type restrictions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling
- **Data Validation**: Automatic validation of encrypted data structure
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of encrypted data in submissions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to resolve import crypto-js"**
   - Run `npm install crypto-js @types/crypto-js`

2. **"Failed to decrypt file"**
   - Check that encryption keys match between frontend and backend
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly

3. **"Uploads directory not found"**
   - The server will create the directory automatically
   - Check file permissions if issues persist

4. **"Invalid encrypted data structure"**
   - Check that all required fields are present in encrypted data
   - Verify file encryption process completed successfully

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```env
DEBUG=true
```

## 📝 Notes

- Files are encrypted client-side before upload
